# PointVerification
Small app to check if the points you've compiled on your Excel and the ones got for Proeco are the same.


How to use it : 
Put the Correct name files (original and encoded) and the column letters you want to compare. One for the name (or ID) one for the points you want to compare.
Just run the code and it will show you if it's OK or not. In the case it isnt't it will show you which lines are concerned.

Tip : put the Excel files in the same repository as the Python file
